## Intro

SummerTrails is a location-service app for users to share photos and pin them to their geo-location on a mapbox map for other users to see in real time.

Users can share where they have been over the summer and the many sights they have seen with other like-minded users.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to connect people around the world during the summer where people are statistically most likely to travel and take holiday.

A [2014 census](https://aytm.com/post/vacations-survey) by Ask Your Target Market found that 59% of respondants said that they book their holidays in the Summer and 46% said they aim for the month of July.

We want to see users sharing cool views from different places on their travels, whether it be from a road trip to the countryside or a flight to a new destination.

Users will be able to see what others are up to and sharing and can also see recommended travel destinations around the world.


## Wireframes, ideas and planning

**Day 1:** We spent a lot of time on the first day discussing ideas based on the criteria set out by C.I.
Some great ideas off the bat included adding weather forecasts bases on your location, creating events for other users in your vicinity and search/fitering events/activities based on interests that authenticated users could save to a user profile.

The project was mapped out and followed on Github Projects.
A link to the project board can be found here: https://github.com/users/Robrowno/projects/6

We immediately knew we wanted to use the Mapbox API, and A first wireframe draft saw us modelling an app that was not too disimilar to the ROADS app by Porsche. An app where users can use their location to find interested local destinations, road trip ideas and meet up with other users who can share their own custom road trip routes.

**Day 2:** On day two, we refined our scope and realised we needed to streamline our focus on getting the frontend right before looking to different features. We went back to the drawing board and came up with an idea of having the map take up the entire screen space - globe front and centre! 

With some hard-coded data we even mapped out how pinned users would appear on the map when they upload an image from their lcoation:

## Bugs/Issues

- We tried to set up a temporary fix for not pushing up our mapbox API early on, however, we had no success with this. We tried to `npm install dotenv` and set up a config.js file for storing out API key but we were not able to successfully import it into the index.js file.

- We had an canvas overflow issue from the nav bar which we solved by inspecting in the console and adding a z-index of 1 to one of the classes properties.
